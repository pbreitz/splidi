# splidi

Splidi helps you split a midi from a controller across multiple channels to create polyphony in multi-track monophonic devices.

Splidi is written in PureData and very likely contains some PD anti-patterns since I have no idea what I'm doing yet. But it sorta works.

Next on the feature list is being able to control midi parameters across all the channels.
